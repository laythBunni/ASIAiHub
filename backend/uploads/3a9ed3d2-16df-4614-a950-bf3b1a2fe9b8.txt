        CHUNKS INVESTIGATION TEST DOCUMENT
        
        This document is created to investigate why chunks_count is 0.
        
        INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:
        - MongoDB mode is working (mongodb_cloud)
        - OpenAI API key is working
        - Documents are being processed successfully
        - But chunks_count remains 0
        
        POSSIBLE CAUSES:
        1. Chunks are being created but not counted properly
        2. Chunks are being stored but document metadata not updated
        3. Processing completes but chunk creation fails silently
        4. Environment loading order issue (fixed but may have residual effects)
        
        This document should be chunked into multiple pieces if the system is working.
        Each chunk should have OpenAI embeddings and be stored in MongoDB.
        The document metadata should show chunks_count > 0.
