The trajectory details the arduous journey of stabilizing the ASI AiHub application, transitioning its RAG system from an unreliable ChromaDB to a persistent MongoDB solution. Initial local tests passed, but persistent production failures necessitated deep debugging. Key challenges included environment variable mismatches, frontend URL misconfigurations, and, critically,  event loop conflicts in FastAPI's ASGI environment. The AI engineer iteratively introduced diagnostics, fixed embedding API key usage (switching from  for embeddings to direct OpenAI with a user-provided key), and ultimately, with the user's help, resolved the core asynchronous execution issue that prevented RAG processing from ever starting in production. The process highlighted the complexities of debugging environment-specific behaviors and the importance of precise  handling.

The ASI AiHub is an AI operations platform, initially designed with a BOOST Ticketing System, Finance SOP management, RAG Chat Function (James AI), rebranding, and admin features. User requirements evolved to include:
1.  **User Management**: Fix UI for role changes, enable user deletion, ensure Manage/Edit/Delete buttons are functional.
2.  **Chat Ticket Creation**: Ensure the Create Ticket button correctly assigns tickets.
3.  **Activity Log**: Implement audit trails for ticket status/priority changes.
4.  **Enhanced Authentication**: Transition from universal  to a personal code system with admin-managed user access, restricting user management to .
5.  **Knowledge Management**: The primary focus of the work so far has been to fix document upload functionality, ensure uploaded files appear in the approval list, and address slow document loading/deletion. Critically, to ensure the RAG chat function returns detailed, structured answers based on the knowledge base (not just no information) and that uploaded documents are properly chunked and persistently stored using the new MongoDB system.
6.  **Ticketing**: Display a full, searchable list of users for assignment and implement View All Tickets button functionality.
7.  **General Stability**: Resolve persistent production deployment issues, including login screen display, backend 500 errors, CORS problems, and RAG system crashes/failures.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer, with critical input from the user, was debugging a persistent  that prevented RAG document processing in the production environment, despite working correctly in the preview. The root cause was identified as an  event loop conflict: the  module was attempting to create and run a new event loop () from within an already running ASGI (FastAPI/Uvicorn) request handler, which is not allowed and raises a . This caused  to fail silently, marking documents as failed without ever starting the actual processing (evidenced by ).

The AI engineer has just implemented the minimal surgical fix to address this. This involved:
1.  Refactoring the document processing logic into an  method, . This method performs the core RAG steps: text extraction (), chunking (), and asynchronous storage to MongoDB ().
2.  Modifying the original  method to act as a synchronous wrapper. This wrapper now intelligently checks if an event loop is already running using . If a loop exists (production ASGI context), it safely schedules the  coroutine using  and awaits its result. If no loop is running (e.g., in a standalone script or test), it uses  to execute the async method directly.
3.  The  and  methods were also updated to use  client with , reflecting the latest embedding model.

This fix is intended to allow the RAG processing to run correctly within the existing asynchronous context of the production FastAPI application, resolving the  and enabling successful document chunking and storage. The version has been updated to .
