The trajectory outlines the evolution of the ASI AiHub application from an MVP to a more production-ready state, primarily driven by a series of critical bug fixes and architectural refinements. Initial efforts focused on debugging RAG, authentication, and enhancing user management. A recurring challenge was persistent production deployment failures, which stemmed from diverse issues: environment variable mismatches, database connectivity (local vs. Atlas), frontend build problems, and proxy/load balancer misconfigurations, especially concerning CORS headers. The AI engineer iteratively diagnosed and fixed issues, moving from local auth remnants to a deeper understanding of deployment environment nuances. A critical pivot involved realizing ChromaDB's unreliability for RAG chunk persistence in production, leading to a significant architectural shift to MongoDB for chunk storage, aiming for a more robust and scalable solution.

<product_requirements>
The ASI AiHub is an AI operations platform, initially designed with a BOOST Ticketing System, Finance SOP management, RAG Chat Function (James AI), rebranding, and admin features.
User requirements evolved to include:
1.  **User Management**: Fix UI for role changes, enable user deletion, ensure Manage/Edit/Delete buttons are functional.
2.  **Chat Ticket Creation**: Ensure the Create Ticket button correctly assigns tickets.
3.  **Activity Log**: Implement audit trails for ticket status/priority changes.
4.  **Enhanced Authentication**: Transition from universal  to a personal code system with admin-managed user access, restricting user management to .
5.  **Knowledge Management**: Fix document upload functionality, ensure uploaded files appear in the approval list, and address slow document loading/deletion.
6.  **Ticketing**: Display a full, searchable list of users for assignment and implement View All Tickets button functionality.
7.  **General Stability**: Resolve persistent production deployment issues, including login screen display, backend 500 errors, CORS problems, and RAG system crashes/failures.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor, Pydantic),  (OpenAI embeddings), .
-   **Frontend**: React, Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, .
-   **AI/RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Vector Embeddings, ChromaDB (initially, then deprecated for MongoDB).
-   **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Supervisor, MongoDB Atlas.
-   **Authentication**: Custom token-based, admin-managed personal codes.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application handling all API routes, authentication, and database interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Initially fixed MongoDB connection, authentication logic (personal codes, admin privileges), user management, and ticket APIs. Recent major changes included removing  and old simple authentication code, implementing robust CORS middleware with dynamic origin handling, adding graceful fallbacks and timeouts for RAG operations, file uploads, and database interactions to prevent crashes, and securing admin endpoints with authentication.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Implements the RAG pipeline for document processing, chunking, embedding generation, and semantic search.
    -   **Changes**: Initially focused on  and . Recent significant changes involved introducing a cloud mode for production (using OpenAI embeddings to avoid local ML model memory issues), and then a full pivot to storing document chunks directly in MongoDB (using a  collection) to ensure persistence across container restarts, replacing the problematic ChromaDB.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing UI, routing, global state, and authentication.
    -   **Changes**: Updated login forms for personal codes, conditional rendering for admin features, bug fixes for user management and ticketing. Recent changes include replacing the  toggle with permission-based access (), enhancing document status display (e.g., Processing..., X chunks), adding better error handling for document deletion, and optimizing initial dashboard loading to prevent long hangs by de-parallelizing heavy API calls.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  was removed.  and  were configured for local and then Atlas, and finally updated with user-provided MongoDB Atlas credentials.  was explicitly set to  to resolve cross-origin issues.

    -   **Importance**: Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  was updated to  for production.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Test MongoDB-based RAG System**: The most recent change, implementing MongoDB for RAG chunk storage, needs to be thoroughly tested in the local environment to ensure document processing, chunk persistence, and chat retrieval work as expected.
-   **Production Deployment**: After local verification, the updated code needs to be deployed to production.
-   **CORS Configuration (Infrastructure)**: While a code-level fix for CORS was applied, the user was advised to contact support to implement an infrastructure-level fix (e.g., same-domain proxy or edge header forwarding) for long-term stability.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had just completed a significant refactor of the RAG system to address persistent production failures related to document chunk storage. The core problem was that ChromaDB, when running in cloud mode in production, was storing document chunks in memory, causing them to disappear every time the container restarted, leading to an empty knowledge base and no information responses from James AI.

The AI engineer implemented a new solution:
1.  **MongoDB-based Chunk Storage**: Replaced ChromaDB with MongoDB for storing document chunks. A new  collection is used.
2.  **OpenAI Embeddings for Production**: Continued to use OpenAI's  for generating embeddings in production, maintaining a lightweight approach that avoids memory exhaustion.
3.  **Unified RAG System**: The  and  files were updated to integrate MongoDB for both storing and retrieving document chunks for RAG queries.

This change aims to ensure that the knowledge base is persistent across production deployments and container restarts, resolving the critical issue of documents not being searchable after processing. The system now uses MongoDB as a reliable backend for RAG data.
