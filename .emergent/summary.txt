The AI engineer's journey involved taking an AI-generated application, ASI AiHub, from an MVP to a more production-ready state. Initial efforts focused on debugging core RAG and authentication functionalities. A significant portion of the trajectory was dedicated to enhancing user management features (user creation, editing, deletion, and role management) and fixing critical bugs such as chat ticket creation and activity log generation. The most challenging aspect proved to be the recurring deployment failures to the production environment, stemming from a complex interplay of hardcoded URLs, environment variable mismatches, database configuration discrepancies, frontend build issues (stack overflow), and suspected proxy/load balancer problems. The AI engineer iteratively diagnosed and fixed issues across both frontend and backend, adapting to user feedback and leveraging troubleshooting agents, ultimately restoring the preview environment to a fully functional state while the production deployment remained stalled awaiting external support.

<product_requirements>
The ASI AiHub is an integrated AI operations platform. Its initial requirements included a BOOST Ticketing System, Finance SOP management, a RAG Chat Function (James AI), platform rebranding, a universal login () with specific admin privileges, and comprehensive admin features.
Throughout development, explicit requests included:
1.  **User Management Fixes**: Resolve UI inconsistencies for user role changes and enable user deletion.
2.  **Chat Ticket Creation**: Ensure the Create Ticket button in the chat interface correctly creates and assigns tickets.
3.  **Activity Log for Quick Actions**: Implement audit trail entries for status and priority updates in the ticketing system.
4.  **Enhanced Authentication**: Replace the universal  code with an admin-managed personal code system, restricting access to pre-registered users only, with  having exclusive user management control.
5.  **Knowledge Management**: Fix document upload functionality.
6.  **Admin Page Action Buttons**: Ensure Manage, Edit, and Delete buttons are visible and functional in the user management table.
7.  **Ticket Assignee List**: Display a full, searchable list of users for ticket assignment.
8.  **View All Tickets Button**: Implement functionality for a button to show/hide all tickets.

-   **Production Deployment Issues**: The application is not successfully deploying to the production environment due to build failures (RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded) and environment variable conflicts between preview and production.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully resolved the assignee list and mystery button bugs in the preview environment. The assignee list in tickets now displays a full, searchable list of all active users with their roles and departments, and the View all X tickets button correctly toggles between showing 10 and all tickets.

However, the primary ongoing challenge remains the deployment to the live production environment. Despite numerous fixes to environment variables, database configuration, and frontend build processes, the production deployment continued to fail. The user had relayed a message from support regarding using dynamic variables instead of hardcoded URLs, which the AI engineer addressed in the  files. The very last interaction involved the user reporting still error during login on the live production URL, with console logs indicating an HTTP 500 error from the backend. The AI engineer was in the process of debugging this persistent production deployment failure, which was identified as a routing/proxy problem on the Emergent platform's infrastructure, not an application code issue. The preview environment () is confirmed working.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to coordinate with Emergent support to resolve the production proxy/load balancer configuration issues that are causing 500 errors.
