The trajectory details the development of the ASI AiHub, an AI-powered operations platform. Initially, the AI engineer focused on building core features: a RAG Chat, Finance SOP builder, and a basic support ticketing system, quickly demonstrating an MVP. A significant pivot occurred when the user requested a robust RAG pipeline for document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, TXT) after issues with a . This led to the implementation of semantic search with vector embeddings and ChromaDB. Further enhancements included a rebranding to ASI AiHub, structured AI responses, a sophisticated document management system with department-specific tabs and administrator approval workflows, and conversation deletion. The latest phase involves building a comprehensive, standalone BOOST ticketing system, with backend API and core frontend components already implemented, pending a final demonstration. Challenges included database schema inconsistencies and ensuring proper document parsing, which were systematically resolved.

The core product is an integrated AI-powered operations platform, initially named ASI OS, now rebranded to ASI AiHub. It combines three capabilities:
1.  **Support (BOOST Ticketing System):** Originally to sync with Zoho Desk, the user later requested it to be a standalone module. It requires auto-categorization (Department → Category → Sub-Category), operational fields (ticket ID, subject, attachments, status, priority, SLA, owner, dependencies, KB links), role-based permissions (Admins, Managers, Department Agents, End Users), and dashboards. The AI is also to auto-generate tickets from chat queries.
2.  **Finance SOP Build:** A structured monthly cycle management including performance review, reporting, budget variance analysis, forecasting, meetings, and approvals by senior management. It requires integration with SAGE Intacct.
3.  **RAG Chat Function:** An AI-powered assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It sources knowledge from uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and the ticketing Knowledge Base, providing plain-English answers.
    *   **Initial RAG:** Required manual document selection by the user.
    *   **RAG Refinement:** User requested the AI to automatically search *all* uploaded documents without manual selection.
    *   **Structured Responses:** User requested AI responses to be in a Business-Focused Structure (summary, details, action_required, contact_info, related_policies).
    *   **Advanced RAG Pipeline:** Due to unreadable PDF files, a full RAG pipeline was requested for proper document parsing, chunking, vector embeddings, and storage for semantic search.
4.  **Platform Rebranding & Enhancements:**
    *   Rename the platform to ASI AiHub.
    *   Document Management: Six specific department tabs for documents (Finance, People & Talent, Information Technology (IT), Legal, Ethics and Compliance (LEC), Business Development (Business Dev), Project Management (Projects), and Other).
    *   Administrator Controls: A system to allow only approved documents into the knowledge base, implying an admin-driven upload and approval workflow.
    *   Conversation Deletion: Ability to delete past chat conversations.

<code_architecture>


-   : This is the main FastAPI application file. It contains all API routes for chat, document management, RAG system integration, user authentication (implicitly, as roles are discussed), and now the BOOST ticketing system. It's crucial as it orchestrates all backend logic, database interactions, and external service (LLM, RAG) calls.
    -   **Changes:** Heavily modified throughout the development.
        -   Initial setup of  prefixed routes, CORS, and MongoDB connection.
        -   Integrated document upload, chat message handling, and RAG functionality.
        -   Added structured response handling, including Pydantic models for structured output.
        -   Implemented document approval, conversation deletion, and endpoints for managing documents by department.
        -   Added a temporary endpoint () to update existing document categories.
        -   Most recently, comprehensive API endpoints for the BOOST Ticketing System (creating, getting, updating tickets, user management, and business unit management) were added.
-   : This new file encapsulates the core RAG pipeline logic. It handles document parsing (PDF, DOCX, TXT), text chunking, generating vector embeddings using , and storing/retrieving these embeddings from ChromaDB.
    -   **Changes:** Created to centralize RAG functionality, separating it from . Includes functions for , , .
-   : The main React component responsible for application layout, routing, and global state. It defines the navigation structure and renders different pages/features.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Updated for new UI/UX, branding (ASI AiHub).
        -   Integrated routing for Dashboard, AI Assistant, Documents, and now Boost Support and Boost Admin.
        -   Updated navigation links and styling to reflect the new department tabs for documents.
-   : A new React component created to beautifully display the AI's structured responses (summary, requirements, procedures, exceptions, action required, contact info, related policies).
    -   **Changes:** New file created to present complex JSON responses in a user-friendly, visually organized format.
-   : (Implicitly exists) This component manages the document upload interface, displays uploaded documents, and handles admin approval workflows.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Implemented the 7 department tabs (Finance, People & Talent, IT, LEC, Business Dev, Projects, Other).

        -   Styling updates for framed tabs and shortened names.
-   : (Implicitly exists) This component provides the AI chat interface.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing the comprehensive BOOST Support Ticketing system. The backend API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and managing tickets, users, and business units have been successfully added to . On the frontend, new React components,  (for the main support interface) and  (for administration), have been created. The main  file has also been updated to include navigation to these new ticketing pages. The last user interaction was a confirmation (yes please) after the creation of the  component, and the AI's stated next step is to restart the backend and demonstrate the completed BOOST Support Ticketing system. This indicates the core structure for the ticketing feature is in place, ready for a final showcase or minor UI/integration adjustments.
